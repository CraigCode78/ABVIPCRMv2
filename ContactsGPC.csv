Eli Broad went on to be a founding chair of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles in 1979, and together they founded the Broad Contemporary Art Museum at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, designed by Renzo Piano, and the Broad Art Museum at Michigan State University, designed by Zaha Hadid. In September 2015, they opened The Broad, a museum in downtown Los Angeles, which is expected to have welcomed close to 1 million visitors by the end of its fourth year, a number that encompasses a younger and more diverse demographic than is typical for museums in the US, reflecting the diversity of Los Angeles. Edythe and Eli Broad are lifelong philanthropists and have donated more than $4 billion to education, science, and the arts, and The Broad Art Foundation has made 8,500 loans to more than 500 museums and galleries around the world. The founder of both SunAmerica Inc. and KB Home, Eli Broad is the only person to have built two Fortune 500 companies in two different industries.

Laura Lee Brown and Steve Wilson, the combined creative force behind 21c Museum Hotels, have found success by using their passion and intuition to guide them in hospitality, farming, preservation, philanthropy, investing, and collecting contemporary art. Aiming to engage the public with art in a new way, they converted vacant buildings in Louisville, Kentucky, into an interactive museum, boutique hotel, and restaurant. Today, 21c Museum Hotels has expanded into eight cities, making the chain a multi-venue museum with more than 75,000 square feet of exhibition space. Much of the art exhibited at 21c Museum Hotels is drawn from the couple’s personal collection of more than 3,000 works.

Monique Burger was born and raised in Switzerland. In the late 1990s she and her husband, Max Burger, began collecting contemporary art, and in 2004, she created the collection’s website to share the works with the public. Her key concerns for the collection are to cultivate artistic dialogue, assume responsibility for the works, conserve the collection, and promote a vision for its future. The Burger Collection went public for the first time in 2009 with a group show in Berlin. The second exhibition was held in Hong Kong in 2013, and the third in 2018/2019 at the Langen Foundation, Neuss, Germany, curated by the independent curator Gianni Jetzer in collaboration with the museum.

2ndgpc","Main residency: Oslo
Since acquiring their first painting in 1985, when their children were young and money was scarce, collecting has become an all-consuming passion for Venke and Rolf Hoff. The travel, the events, and the many artist friends they’ve gained along the way have given them many fond memories, though they have never collected for those reasons alone. ‘You must want the thing, be irresistibly drawn to the work itself. Don’t choose a work because of beauty, that will quickly bore you. Don’t feel you need to understand a work before you buy, that will come later. Or perhaps you never will, but that’s OK, too,’ say the couple. In 2013, the Hoffs opened the KaviarFactory in a disused factory building in the fishing village of Henningsv.r, in the archipelago of Lofoten, Norway. Run as a dynamic Kunsthalle, it aims to connect with both a local and global audience. The KaviarFactory is not the home of the Hoffs’ collection, nor is the collection built with the KaviarFactory in mind, but their collecting opens doors that are perhaps not available to other institutions of this size.

Since acquiring their first painting in 1985, when their children were young and money was scarce, collecting has become an all-consuming passion for Venke and Rolf Hoff. The travel, the events, and the many artist friends they’ve gained along the way have given them many fond memories, though they have never collected for those reasons alone. ‘You must want the thing, be irresistibly drawn to the work itself. Don’t choose a work because of beauty, that will quickly bore you. Don’t feel you need to understand a work before you buy, that will come later. Or perhaps you never will, but that’s OK, too,’ say the couple. In 2013, the Hoffs opened the KaviarFactory in a disused factory building in the fishing village of Henningsv.r, in the archipelago of Lofoten, Norway. Run as a dynamic Kunsthalle, it aims to connect with both a local and global audience. The KaviarFactory is not the home of the Hoffs’ collection, nor is the collection built with the KaviarFactory in mind, but their collecting opens doors that are perhaps not available to other institutions of this size.

Her parents would take her with them to visit the artists’ exhibitions and studios. In the 1990s, she took over the care of the family collection and began a personal collection with her husband, Piervittorio Leopardi. Being attracted to photography at first, she also looked to African artists. Later she included painting and sculpture by artists such as Urs Fischer, Ugo Rondinone, Damien Hirst, Franz West, the Chapman Brothers, Mark Bradford, Wim Delvoye, Rudolf Stingel, and Jeff Koons.

Maurizio devoted the last 15 years in renovating this wonderful palace, he literally fighted for it: over 2000 sq metres on three floors with original frescos. The results are truly impressive and the Museum will play for sure a very important role in the contemperary art world, continuing supporting the local public Institutions such as Museo Madre and bringing to experience the city and to produce there important international artists.

Maurizio Morra Greco, a dentist, began purchasing ancient and Modern art as a young man. In the early 1990s, he started to turn his attention towards contemporary art, collecting emerging artists of his generation, who subsequently achieved international fame, and building up a collection that is both eclectic and has strong thematic focuses. In 2006, he founded the Fondazione Morra Greco in Naples, which plays host to an intense program of exhibitions and residencies for national and international artists, who produce new projects while in Naples that chime with the city’s tradition of contemporary art. The foundation and collection is housed at the recently renovated Palazzo Caracciolo di Avellino, a 15th-century building in the heart of the historic center of Naples.

Walter Vanhaerents started collecting art in the mid-1970s. Originally fascinated with film, in particular by Andy Warhol, he quickly acquired works by iconic artists such as Bruce Nauman, Matthew Barney, and Cindy Sherman. Besides film, architecture and visits to newly built museums introduced him to contemporary art. ‘I had been collecting classical pieces for about five years by then. But the art that I saw in these museums had a completely different energy. It changed the way I see things and phenomena.’ Today, his contemporary art collection has grown into a multifaceted hidden treasure, containing some of the most relevant established artists of the modern day, as well as emerging and contemporary artists of the past decade. The Vanhaerents Art Collection – a 3,500-square-meter industrial building opened in 2007 in the heart of Brussels - is a unique institution on the present-day Belgian art scene. In 2019, the collection will be represented for the second time at the Venice Biennale.

Laura Lee Brown and Steve Wilson, the combined creative force behind 21c Museum Hotels, have found success by using their passion and intuition to guide them in hospitality, farming, preservation, philanthropy, investing, and collecting contemporary art. Aiming to engage the public with art in a new way, they converted vacant buildings in Louisville, Kentucky, into an interactive museum, boutique hotel, and restaurant. Today, 21c Museum Hotels has expanded into eight cities, making the chain a multi-venue museum with more than 75,000 square feet of exhibition space. Much of the art exhibited at 21c Museum Hotels is drawn from the couple’s personal collection of more than 3,000 works. Their approach is to never buy for investment, but rather for the love of the work. Laura Lee and Steve currently serve on the National Committee of the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, and were formerly on the board of the Speed Art Museum, Louisville. Steve is also a founding member and past president of the Kentucky Museum of Art and Craft.
